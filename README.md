Provides an enum representing every pixel format supported by DRM
(as of kernel version 5.10.0).

A [fourcc][fourcc_wiki] is four bytes of ascii representing some data format. This enum contains
every fourcc representing a pixel format supported by [DRM][drm_wiki], the Linux Direct
Rendering Manager.

To get the bytes of the fourcc representing the format, cast to `u32`.

```rust
assert_eq!(DrmFourcc::Xrgb8888 as u32, 875713112);
```

To get the string form of the fourcc, use [`DrmFourcc::string_form`].

```rust
assert_eq!(DrmFourcc::Xrgb8888.string_form(), "XR24");
```

The enum is autogenerated from the [canonical list][canonical] in the Linux source code.
